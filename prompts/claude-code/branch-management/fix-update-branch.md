## Fix & Update Branch

Prioritize clear, maintainable, and efficient code and organization, delivering robust, fully featured, and best-practice solutions without unnecessary complexity. Solutions should be simple, yet powerful and comprehensive.

1. Before starting, check for and continue with any existing subtasks in your built-in TODO tool from the previous review phase. If new changes are needed, break them down into actionable subtasks.
2. Actively manage, update, and communicate progress on these TODO tool subtasks as you address all feedback, comments, and issues (including Sourcery-AI, CI, and reviewer suggestions).
3. Make all required code, test, and documentation changes for approval.
4. Double-check that all acceptance criteria and requirements for the branch are met.
5. Always run all relevant tests, linters, and formatters; fix all issues before pushing updates to the branch.
6. Update any branch-related documentation or notes if major changes were made.
7. Push latest commits; ensure all tests, linters, and formatters pass.
8. Add a summary comment in your project tracker, issue, or branch notes outlining the changes made in response to review feedback, and note any remaining concerns or requests for further input.
9. Ensure that all TODO files (`TODO.md`, and any project or module-specific TODO files) and all relevant documentation are updated to reflect the latest changes and status.
10. At the end, ensure your built-in TODO tool's subtasks for this branch are up to date for the next reviewer or developer to pick up seamlessly.
