## Start Branch Review

Prioritize clear, maintainable, and efficient code and organization, delivering robust, fully featured, and best-practice solutions without unnecessary complexity. Solutions should be simple, yet powerful and comprehensive.

1. Begin a thorough review of the specified Git branch.
2. Before starting, check for any existing review subtasks in your built-in TODO tool from previous review cycles. Continue with these if present; otherwise, break down new review and improvement steps into actionable subtasks in your TODO tool.
3. Actively manage, update, and communicate progress on these subtasks as you work through the review.
4. Read all code changes, commit messages, comments, and automated checks (including tools like Sourcery-AI, CI, and linters) associated with the branch.
5. Summarize the purpose of the branch, main changes introduced, and any high-level concerns or areas needing attention.
6. Identify unresolved issues, ambiguous logic, or places needing more testing or documentation.
7. Add actionable, concise feedback either as in-line comments on the branch (if your system supports this), or compile a detailed "AI Review" comment summarizing findings, issues, suggestions, and recommended next steps. If commenting in-line isn't possible, document your feedback clearly in a central place (e.g., issue tracker, shared doc, or as a markdown file in the branch).
8. Mark review progress and communicate any remaining subtasks for the next reviewer or developer, ensuring the latest state of the review TODOs is available to anyone picking up the branch.
