## Start Pull Request Review

**Prioritize clear, maintainable, and efficient code and organization, delivering robust, fully featured, and best-practice solutions without unnecessary complexity. Solutions should be simple, yet powerful and comprehensive.**

1. Begin a thorough review of the new pull request.
2. Before starting, check for any existing review subtasks in your built-in TODO tool from previous review cycles. Continue with these if present; otherwise, break down new review and improvement steps into actionable subtasks in your TODO tool.
3. Actively manage, update, and communicate progress on these subtasks as you work through the review.
4. Read all code changes, comments, suggestions, and checks (including automated tools like Sourcery-AI, CI, and linters).
5. Summarize the purpose of the PR, main changes, and any high-level concerns or areas needing attention.
6. Identify unresolved issues, ambiguous logic, or places needing more testing or documentation.
7. Add actionable, concise feedback directly as comments on the pull request, or submit a single detailed "AI Review" comment summarizing your findings, issues, suggestions, and recommended next steps.
8. Mark review progress and communicate any remaining subtasks for the next reviewer or developer, ensuring the latest state of the review TODOs is available to anyone picking up the PR.
