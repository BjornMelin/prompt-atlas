## Contributing

When adding new slash commands:

1. Follow the existing file structure with proper `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder
2. Place commands in the most appropriate subdirectory
3. Update this README.md file with the new command
4. Ensure command names are descriptive and follow the existing naming conventions
