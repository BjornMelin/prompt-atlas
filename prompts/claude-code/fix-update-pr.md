## Fix & Update Pull Request

**Prioritize clear, maintainable, and efficient code and organization, delivering robust, fully featured, and best-practice solutions without unnecessary complexity. Solutions should be simple, yet powerful and comprehensive.**

1. Before starting, check for and continue with any existing subtasks in your built-in TODO tool from the previous review phase. If new changes are needed, break them down into actionable subtasks.
2. Actively manage, update, and communicate progress on these TODO tool subtasks as you address all feedback, comments, and issues (including Sourcery-AI, CI, and reviewer suggestions).
3. Make all required code, test, and documentation changes for approval.
4. Double-check that all acceptance criteria and requirements are met.
5. Always run all relevant tests, linters, and formatters; fix all issues before updating the PR.
6. Update the PR description if major changes were made.
7. Push latest commits; ensure all tests, linters, and formatters pass.
8. Add a comment or reply to your own "AI Review" comment on the PR summarizing the changes made in response to review feedback, and note any remaining concerns or requests for further input.
9. Ensure that all TODO files (`TODO.md`, and any project or module-specific TODO files) and all relevant documentation are updated to reflect the latest changes and status.
10. At the end, ensure your built-in TODO tool's subtasks for this PR are up to date for the next reviewer or developer to pick up seamlessly.
