## Complete Highest Priority TODO Task

**Prioritize clear, maintainable, and efficient code and organization, delivering robust, fully featured, and best-practice solutions without unnecessary complexity. Solutions should be simple, yet powerful and comprehensive.**

1. Read `@TODO.md` and select the single highest-priority main entry or feature to implement next.
2. Review relevant official docs, community examples, and project documentation for context. Reference project docs throughout and keep them updated.
3. Break down the selected task into actionable subtasks using your built-in TODO tool. Actively manage and mark subtasks as you work.
4. Use MCP server tools for research and implementation:
   - `firecrawl_scrape`: Scrape/extract content from official docs and reference links.
   - `firecrawl_crawl`: Crawl doc sites for deeper or related content.
   - `firecrawl_deep_research`: For in-depth research on complex or broad topics.
   - `context7`: Fetch, read, and analyze API/library docs for examples/usage.
   - `exa`: For codebase exploration/static analysis.
   - `tavily`, `linkup`: For web search and community best practices if official docs lack detail.
   - `sequential-thinking`: For systematic reasoning or complex planning.
5. Plan and justify your approach for each subtask, based on research, best practices, and documentation.
6. Create a new branch (conventional-commits format). Implement the task, focusing on maintainability, clarity, and feature-completeness.
7. Build or update the test suite for all new/changed code. Run `uv pytest` and ensure all tests pass.
8. Always run `uv ruff lint` and `uv ruff format` on all files worked on. **Fix all linting/formatting issues before committing or submitting a PR.**
9. Once all TODO tool subtasks are complete, update `@TODO.md` to reflect completion, and add new/follow-up tasks if needed.
10. Update all relevant documentation, READMEs, and project docs to reflect changes, progress, and design decisions.
11. Commit and push changes. Open a PR via GitHub MCP server tools.
12. **STOP HERE** â€” Do not merge; use your PR review/merge command next.
13. **Final reminders:** Summarize any unresolved questions, ambiguities, or next steps; structure outputs logically with actionable details and referenced decisions; justify all major decisions with research and/or best practices; keep reference links handy for rapid doc lookups and optimal solutions.
