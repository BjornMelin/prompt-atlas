## Finalize & Merge Pull Request

**Prioritize clear, maintainable, and efficient code and organization, delivering robust, fully featured, and best-practice solutions without unnecessary complexity. Solutions should be simple, yet powerful and comprehensive.**

1. Before starting, check for any remaining review subtasks in your built-in TODO tool. Confirm that all have been completed before proceeding.
2. Confirm all TODO files (`TODO.md`, and any project or module-specific TODO files) and all project documentation are updated to fully reflect all changes and work completed in the PR.
3. Ensure all automated checks, reviews, tests, and linters have passed.
4. Summarize any remaining open questions or future improvements in a final PR comment or in the PR description for visibility to the next reviewer, developer, or future maintainer.
5. Merge the PR to the `main` branch via the approved workflow.
6. After merging:
   - Checkout `main` locally.
   - Run: `git pull`, `git fetch`, `git prune`.
   - Clean up merged branches locally and remotely.
7. Communicate the successful merge and summarize changes to relevant team members if needed, either in a final PR comment or in team channels.
