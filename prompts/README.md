## Usage Guidelines

1. **Tool-Specific Workflows**: Use the appropriate tool directory for platform-specific prompts (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)

2. **Domain Expertise**: Leverage domain directories for technical implementation guidance

3. **Prompt Engineering**: Utilize meta-prompting tools for creating custom prompts

4. **Combinations**: Mix and match prompts from different categories as needed for complex workflows

## Contributing

When adding new prompts:
- Place tool-specific prompts in their respective tool directories
- Use domain directories for technical/implementation focused content  
- Include clear documentation and usage examples
- Follow the established naming conventions

## Structure Philosophy

This organization prioritizes:
- **Tool-based workflows** - Easy to find prompts for your specific development environment
- **Domain expertise** - Quick access to specialized knowledge areas
- **Flat hierarchy** - Minimal nesting for maximum discoverability
- **Clear separation** - Distinct categories prevent overlap and confusion
